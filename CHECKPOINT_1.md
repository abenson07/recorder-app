# Checkpoint 1: Initial Expo Setup Complete ✅

## What's Been Done

1. ✅ Created `react-native-build` branch
2. ✅ Reorganized project structure to monorepo:
   - `web/` - Original React web app (untouched)
   - `native/` - New Expo React Native app
   - `shared/` - Shared code directory (store, utilities)
3. ✅ Initialized Expo project with TypeScript template
4. ✅ Installed core dependencies:
   - expo-av (audio recording/playback)
   - @react-native-async-storage/async-storage (storage)
   - react-native-paper (UI library)
   - @react-navigation/native + stack (navigation)
5. ✅ Created platform abstraction layer (`shared/lib/platform.ts`, `shared/lib/storage.ts`)
6. ✅ Set up basic navigation with React Navigation
7. ✅ Configured app.json with permissions and dark theme

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start Expo dev server:**
   ```bash
   cd native
   npx expo start
   ```

2. **On your Android phone:**
   - Install Expo Go from Play Store
   - Make sure phone and computer are on same Wi-Fi
   - Scan the QR code from terminal
   - App should launch showing "Dashboard Screen"

3. **What to verify:**
   - ✅ App launches without errors
   - ✅ Dark theme background (#101010)
   - ✅ "Dashboard Screen" text visible
   - ✅ No console errors

## If There Are Issues

- **Metro bundler errors:** Try `cd native && npm install` again
- **Can't connect to Expo Go:** Check Wi-Fi, ensure phone and computer on same network
- **Permission errors:** We'll address when we get to audio recording

## Next Steps (After You Confirm)

Once you confirm this works, I'll proceed with:
- Phase 3: Convert Zustand store to use shared platform abstraction
- Phase 4: Start converting audio recording to Expo AV

Let me know when you've tested and we'll continue!
