# Conversion Progress Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed: 6/6 Core Phases (100%)

### Phase 1: Monorepo Setup ‚úÖ
- [x] Created `native/` directory structure
- [x] Set up Expo project with TypeScript
- [x] Configured React Navigation and React Native Paper
- [x] Set up shared code structure

### Phase 2: Store Conversion ‚úÖ
- [x] Migrated Zustand store to platform-agnostic structure
- [x] Created storage adapters for web and native
- [x] Implemented AsyncStorage for native, localStorage/IndexedDB for web
- [x] Platform-specific file storage using Expo FileSystem

### Phase 3: Dashboard Conversion ‚úÖ
- [x] Converted Dashboard component to React Native
- [x] Implemented FlatList for recordings list
- [x] Added FAB (Floating Action Button) for new recordings
- [x] Navigation integration

### Phase 4: Recording Conversion ‚úÖ
- [x] Converted useRecorder hook to use Expo AV
- [x] Implemented native Recording component
- [x] Added control buttons (Pause/Resume, Stop & Save, Delete)
- [x] Fixed FileSystem deprecation (using legacy API)
- [x] Auto-start recording on mount
- [x] Duration tracking and storage

### Phase 5: Playback Conversion ‚úÖ
- [x] Converted usePlayer hook to use Expo AV Sound
- [x] Implemented native Playback component
- [x] Added playback controls (Play/Pause, Stop, Delete)
- [x] Status polling for position updates
- [x] Seek functionality

### Phase 6: Waveform Visualization ‚úÖ
- [x] **Playback Waveform**: Full-width waveform with progress visualization
  - Uses react-native-svg for rendering
  - Tap-to-seek functionality
  - Played portion (white) vs unplayed portion (gray, 50% opacity)
  - Synthetic peak generation (placeholder for real audio processing)
- [x] **Recording Waveform**: Real-time waveform flowing outward from center
  - Mirrored horizontal visualization
  - 500px tall, 50% opacity
  - Preserves history when paused (no restart on resume)
  - Synthetic peak generation (placeholder for real audio processing)

## üîß Additional Improvements Completed

### Production Readiness ‚úÖ
- [x] Improved error handling with user-friendly messages
- [x] Permission error handling with auto-navigation
- [x] Graceful handling of missing files
- [x] Input validation for duration display
- [x] TypeScript type safety (all errors resolved)
- [x] File size limit removed (unlimited recording size)
- [x] Documentation created (README, CONVERSION_STATUS)

## üìä Progress Breakdown

### Core Conversion: 100% Complete
**Status**: All 6 phases complete. The app is functionally equivalent to the web version.

**What Works**:
- ‚úÖ Recording (start, pause, resume, stop, save)
- ‚úÖ Playback (play, pause, stop, seek)
- ‚úÖ Navigation (Dashboard ‚Üî Recording ‚Üî Playback)
- ‚úÖ Storage (save, load, delete recordings)
- ‚úÖ Waveform visualization (both recording and playback)
- ‚úÖ Error handling and user feedback

### Production Readiness: ~30% Complete
**Status**: Core functionality is production-ready, but build/deployment needs work.

**Completed**:
- [x] Error handling improvements
- [x] Type safety
- [x] Basic configuration (app.json)

**Remaining**:
- [ ] Android build configuration
- [ ] iOS build configuration  
- [ ] App icons and splash screens (assets exist, but may need optimization)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Testing on physical devices

### Enhancements: 0% Complete
**Status**: Nice-to-have improvements for future.

**Remaining**:
- [ ] Real audio waveform generation (replace synthetic peaks)
- [ ] Additional UI polish
- [ ] Accessibility improvements
- [ ] Offline functionality verification

## üéØ Overall Progress: ~75% Complete

**Core Conversion**: 100% ‚úÖ  
**Production Readiness**: ~30%  
**Enhancements**: 0% (optional)

**Next Priority**: Production readiness (build config, device testing)

## üìù Notes

- The app is **ready for device testing** and basic usage
- All TypeScript errors are resolved
- No linter errors
- Core functionality matches web version
- Synthetic waveforms work but can be replaced with real audio processing later
- Build configuration needed for actual device deployment
