# Checkpoint 2: Storage Conversion Complete ✅

## What's Been Done

1. ✅ Created platform-specific storage adapters:
   - `web/src/lib/storageAdapter.ts` - Wraps localStorage/IndexedDB
   - `native/src/lib/storageAdapter.ts` - Wraps AsyncStorage + FileSystem
2. ✅ Converted Zustand store to use shared platform abstraction:
   - Moved store to `shared/store/useStore.ts`
   - Store accepts platform-specific storage functions via `setStorageFunctions()`
   - Web and native initialize store with their respective adapters
3. ✅ Set up shared code structure:
   - Shared store uses dependency injection pattern
   - Platform-specific initialization in each app's store wrapper
4. ✅ Fixed import paths and TypeScript compilation:
   - Web: Copied shared code to `web/src/shared/` for CRA compatibility
   - Native: Uses symlink via node_modules for imports
   - Both compile successfully

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Web App (should still work):**
   ```bash
   cd web
   npm start
   ```
   - Verify dashboard loads
   - Verify recordings can be saved/loaded
   - Should function exactly as before

2. **Test Native App:**
   ```bash
   cd native
   npx expo start
   ```
   - App should launch in Expo Go
   - Dashboard screen should show
   - No errors in console (storage won't have data yet, that's expected)

## What to Verify

- ✅ Web app still compiles and runs
- ✅ Native app compiles (TypeScript check passes)
- ✅ Native app launches in Expo Go without crashes
- ✅ No console errors on app start

## Known Issues to Address Later

- FileSystem.documentDirectory TypeScript type issue (using workaround)
- Native app needs audio recording implementation (next phase)

## Next Steps (After You Confirm)

Once you confirm both apps work:
- Phase 4: Convert audio recording to Expo AV
- Phase 4.2: Convert audio playback
- Phase 4.3: Convert waveform visualization

Let me know when you've tested and we'll continue!
