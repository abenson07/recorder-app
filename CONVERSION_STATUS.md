# React Native Conversion Status

## ✅ Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Monorepo Setup
- Created `native/` directory structure
- Set up Expo project with TypeScript
- Configured React Navigation and React Native Paper
- Set up shared code structure

### Phase 2: Store Conversion
- Migrated Zustand store to platform-agnostic structure
- Created storage adapters for web and native
- Implemented AsyncStorage for native, localStorage/IndexedDB for web
- Platform-specific file storage using Expo FileSystem

### Phase 3: Dashboard Conversion
- Converted Dashboard component to React Native
- Implemented FlatList for recordings list
- Added FAB (Floating Action Button) for new recordings
- Navigation integration

### Phase 4: Recording Conversion
- Converted useRecorder hook to use Expo AV
- Implemented native Recording component
- Added control buttons (Pause/Resume, Stop & Save, Delete)
- Fixed FileSystem deprecation (using legacy API)
- Auto-start recording on mount

### Phase 5: Playback Conversion
- Converted usePlayer hook to use Expo AV Sound
- Implemented native Playback component
- Added playback controls (Play/Pause, Stop, Delete)
- Status polling for position updates

### Phase 6: Waveform Visualization
- **Playback Waveform**: Full-width waveform with progress visualization
  - Uses react-native-svg for rendering
  - Tap-to-seek functionality
  - Played portion (white) vs unplayed portion (gray, 50% opacity)
  - Synthetic peak generation (placeholder for real audio processing)

- **Recording Waveform**: Real-time waveform flowing outward from center
  - Mirrored horizontal visualization
  - 500px tall, 50% opacity
  - Preserves history when paused (no restart on resume)
  - Synthetic peak generation (placeholder for real audio processing)

## 📝 Current Status

**Core Functionality: ✅ Complete**
- Recording (start, pause, resume, stop, save)
- Playback (play, pause, stop, seek)
- Navigation (Dashboard ↔ Recording ↔ Playback)
- Storage (save, load, delete recordings)
- Waveform visualization (both recording and playback)

## 🔄 Known Limitations

1. **Waveform Peak Generation**: Currently using synthetic peaks
   - Recording waveform: Synthetic wave pattern with variation
   - Playback waveform: Synthetic peaks based on duration
   - **Future Enhancement**: Integrate real audio processing library (e.g., react-native-audio-waveform)

2. **Web-Specific Components Not Converted**:
   - Controls.tsx (bottom control bar - not needed in native, controls are embedded)
   - Dial.tsx, Light.tsx, Speaker.tsx (decorative UI components - web design specific)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Production Readiness
- [ ] Android build configuration
- [ ] iOS build configuration  
- [ ] App icons and splash screens
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Error handling improvements
- [ ] Testing on physical devices

### Enhancements
- [ ] Real audio waveform generation (replace synthetic peaks)
- [ ] Additional UI polish
- [ ] Accessibility improvements
- [ ] Offline functionality verification

## 🔧 Technical Notes

- **Metro Bundler**: Cannot use symlinks, so `shared/` is copied to `native/src/shared/`
- **FileSystem**: Using `expo-file-system/legacy` to avoid deprecation warnings
- **Storage**: Native uses AsyncStorage + Expo FileSystem, Web uses localStorage + IndexedDB
- **Audio**: Native uses Expo AV, Web uses MediaRecorder API
